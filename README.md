# Expense Tracker — Frontend (Visualization)

A frontend-only Expense Tracker with clean UI, category filtering, search/sort, dark-mode toggle, and interactive charts (Chart.js). Data is persisted to Local Storage.

Files added
- `index.html` — main UI, includes Bootstrap and Chart.js via CDN.
- `css/styles.css` — custom styling and dark-mode rules.
- `js/app.js` — app logic: localStorage, rendering, charts, filters.

How to run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click -> Open with...).
2. Add expenses using the form. Charts update immediately.

Notes / Next steps
- Export/import CSV, category manager, and sync to backend are logical next features.
- You can swap Bootstrap for Tailwind if preferred (small CSS changes required).

Enjoy!
